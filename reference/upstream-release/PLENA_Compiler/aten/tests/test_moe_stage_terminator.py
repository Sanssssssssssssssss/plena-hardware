"""Guards on the MoE region terminator.

These cover a failure that produces a plausible-looking wrong answer rather than
an error, which is why it is pinned here rather than left to a numerical test.

The terminator exists because markers are sticky and a program does not end
where its MoE region does. Without one, the last MoE marker runs to the end of
the file and every instruction after it -- an lm_head, the next sublayer -- is
billed to a MoE stage, and that cost lands in the shared-vs-routed ratio. The
size of the effect is whatever the epilogue happens to be, so it is measured in
the pull request rather than pinned here, where it would rot.
