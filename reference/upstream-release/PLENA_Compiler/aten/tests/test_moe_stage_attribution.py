"""Static guards on the MoE ``@stage=`` attribution contract.

Stage markers are *sticky and authoritative*: once a program emits any marker,
the emulator disables its legacy substring rules and bills every subsequent
instruction to the most recent marker. Two consequences drive the tests here.

1. A helper called from inside a marked region inherits the enclosing marker.
   So an emitter reused across stages must be told which one it is serving, and
   a **default** for that parameter is a silent wrong answer rather than a
   missing one.

2. A misattributed stage does not change instruction counts, cycle totals or
   numerical results. Nothing downstream fails. The only place the mistake is
   visible is the source line that omitted the argument -- so that is where it
   has to be caught.

These guards read the source with :mod:`ast` rather than importing the modules
and using :mod:`inspect`. ``_DEPRECATED_METHOD_ALIASES`` rebinds emitters onto
the mixin via ``setattr``, so a signature walk over class attributes sees the
same function twice and the declaration site not at all -- and literal
``stage=`` *arguments*, which the stage-name guard is built on, are invisible
to it.
