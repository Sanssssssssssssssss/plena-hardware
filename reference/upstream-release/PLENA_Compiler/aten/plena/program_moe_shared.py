"""Shared-expert MoE program-builder helpers.

A *shared* expert is an FFN every token passes through, running alongside the
routed experts and summed into the same output:

    y = shared(x) + sum_k route_weight_k * routed_expert_k(x)

``n_shared`` is deliberately not a parameter here: the count is a checkpoint
loading concern, not an emission one. :func:`fused_shared_intermediate` does the
conversion.

Cost shape, and why it is worth measuring separately
----------------------------------------------------
The shared expert is dense over every token, so its cost is
``rows * (2*hidden*inter_s + inter_s*hidden)`` regardless of routing, while the
routed branch scales with ``rows * top_k``. Its weights are also *hot* -- every
token needs them -- so unlike routed weights they do not have to be re-fetched
per (token, expert) pair.

That last difference is why these emitters bill to their own stages
(``shared_expert_*``) rather than reusing the routed ones: without the split, the
profile cannot answer what fraction of MoE time is architecturally dense.

**Read the resulting split with care.** :data:`SHARED_VS_ROUTED_NOTE` states the
caveat, and is the canonical wording that travels with the measurement into the
profile JSON.

    DeepSeek-V2/V3 do not run their shared experts separately; ``DeepseekV2MoE``
    instantiates one ``DeepseekV2MLP`` of width
    ``moe_intermediate_size * n_shared_experts`` whose weights are the shared
    experts concatenated along the intermediate axis. Because SwiGLU is applied
    elementwise along that axis and the down projection sums over it, the fused
    MLP equals the sum of the individual shared experts **in exact real
    arithmetic**. The fusion is an algebraic identity, not an approximation.

    It is not bit-identical as emitted, for two separate reasons:

    - The down projection reduces over the whole concatenated axis in one pass,
      where the unfused form does ``n_shared_experts`` reductions and adds the
      results. Floating-point addition is not associative, so the roundings
      differ even in a format with no quantisation involved.
    - Expert weights are stored MXFP8 (e4m3 elements, one e8m0 scale per block
      of 8 along that axis). If ``moe_intermediate_size`` is not a multiple of
      that block, the fused tensor's blocks straddle expert boundaries, so a
      block's scale is chosen from values belonging to two different experts and
      the quantised weights themselves differ -- not just their sum.

    Neither makes the fusion wrong, but a bit-exactness test written against the
    unfused form would fail for correct reasons.

        ``gate_weight_row`` holds the ``[hidden, 1]`` gate projection stored as a
        single BF16 VRAM row of length ``hidden``, so the per-token projection is a
        dot product rather than a matmul. Going through the matrix path would mean
        padding a one-column weight out to MLEN and discarding 63/64 of the result.

        Returns a ``[rows, hidden]`` VRAM matrix holding each token's scalar gate
        broadcast across the hidden axis, ready to multiply the shared expert
        output. That is the same shape and mechanism the routed branch uses for
        route weights, so the two are combined identically downstream.

        Two limits worth knowing before you reach them:

        - ``name`` must be unique within a program. The scratch buffers are
          derived from it, so calling this twice with the default is a collision,
          not a second gate.
        - ``rows`` is bounded by FPRAM. One gate scalar per token, plus the
          ``one`` and ``neg_one`` constants which must themselves be at least
          ``rows`` long, out of 1024 f16 slots shared with everything else -- so
          the ceiling is near ``rows * 3``, not ``rows``. Measured at 297 with a
          caller that sizes every other constant to 1; a realistically-shaped
          caller runs out sooner.

        Static instruction count grows with ``rows`` -- the token loop is unrolled
        at emit time -- and the per-token cost grows with ``hidden`` as well, but
        that second part is the broadcast helper's, not this loop's: measured 27
        instructions per token at ``hidden=64`` against 182 at ``hidden=2048``,
        while the dot-product loop itself is one ``C_LOOP`` regardless. A codegen
        follow-up, not a correctness limit.
